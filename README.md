## :dart: About ##
Hi there! I'm Tash, an aspiring software engineer from London. I love python, and I'm always eager to learn and explore new things in the world of coding. I am currently doing a Sotfware Engineering bootcamp with Hyperiondev and some of the repositories you see in profile are projects part of my bootcamp.

## :sparkles: Projects ##
Here are some of the projects I've been working on:

1. [byb_project](https://github.com/TahshR/byb_project.git) - Part of task for Hyperiodev Software Engineering bootcamp, create a simple code to print out a message.
2. [finalCapstone](https://github.com/TahshR/finalCapstone.git) - Part of task for Hyperiodev Software Engineering bootcamp, create a task manager.
   <!-- Add more projects as needed -->
